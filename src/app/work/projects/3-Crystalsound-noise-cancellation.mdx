## Overview

CrystalSound was created during the COVID-19 pandemic to improve the quality of online meetings by removing background noise and echo interference. It targeted both individual users and enterprises seeking to enhance call clarity. The product runs in real-time and was distributed as a desktop application, with special integration into hardware (e.g., IO Data speakers).

## Key Features

- Real-time LSTM-based noise suppression and echo cancellation using SpeexDSP.
- Virtual audio driver for audio routing on Windows, developed using IO control.
- WPF-based user interface (C#) for configuration and user interaction.
- Cross-platform support for Windows and macOS.
- Full installer packaged using WiX Toolset with CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- End-to-end latency logged and maintained under 200ms.

## Technologies Used

- **Noise Suppression**: LSTM-based model (details managed by a separate team).
- **Echo Cancellation**: SpeexDSP integrated into the real-time pipeline.
- **Driver Development**: Custom virtual driver using Windows kernel-mode base.
- **Build Tools**: CMake, WiX Toolset, GitHub Actions.
- **UI**: WPF (C#).

## Challenges and Learnings

- Built asynchronous, modular processing pipelines with careful buffer management to avoid data loss.
- Tested drivers in virtual environments due to system-level risks of kernel driver bugs.
- Avoided conflicts by intercepting audio streams as standalone modules layered over native Windows drivers.
- Manual testing by QA team using multiple real-world scenarios (Google Meet, Zalo, Skype) validated latency and voice clarity.

## Outcome

- Publicly available as a free desktop application with premium features.
- Deployed in enterprise settings at FPT Telecom, IO Data, and others.
- Positive feedback from FPT Telecom: “CrystalSound is a simple but robust tool essential for customer service centers like us. With CrystalSound, we increase not only customer satisfaction but employee productivity also.”
- Supports both B2C downloads and B2B integrations into corporate workflows and hardware.
