## Overview

The CCTV ReID system was developed to help track people across multiple surveillance cameras with both overlapping and non-overlapping fields of view. It supports identity continuity even when the same person moves through different camera zones, ensuring area access monitoring, identity recognition, and trajectory tracking. The PoC involved 4 fixed-position cameras and was demonstrated live to SoftBank Japan.

## Key Features

- Combined person detection (YOLOv5) with face embeddings (RetinaFace + ArcFace) for multi-modal ReID.
- Used vector embeddings of both faces and full-body appearance stored in a vector database.
- Implemented fallback re-identification via feature matching even when face was not visible.
- Integrated post-processing with ID filtering and cross-camera matching.
- Visualized trajectory tracking on a 2D mapped web interface showing movement across zones.

## Technologies Used

- **Detection**: YOLOv5 (pretrained), RetinaFace.
- **Embedding**: ArcFace, DeepStream-optimized feature extraction.
- **Platform**: DeepStream SDK (Python pipeline), Jetson Orin, RTX 3090.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Occlusion or similar clothing sometimes caused ID switching or duplication.
- Lighting and camera angles significantly impacted body feature consistency.
- Real-time processing required frame rate reduction on Jetson Orin (15 FPS vs 30+ FPS on RTX).
- Edge deployment required architecture-independent, cross-platform code and optimization.
- Learned to work with hardware constraints and keep unified logic for multi-device deployment.

## Outcome

- Successful live demo with SoftBank Japan; stakeholders satisfied and approved next deployment phases.
- Real-time trajectory mapping confirmed accurate cross-camera tracking.
- Initial architecture designed to scale toward 500+ cameras in production.
